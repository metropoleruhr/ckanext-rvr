Gets datasets that have data in their `spatial` fields, but NO data in their \
`dataset_spatial` fields and the data in their `spatial` field IS DIFFERENT \
from that in the organization's `org_spatial` field, indicating that the \
dataset has not been prepared to use the spatial inheritance feature of the \
ckanext-rvr extension. For these datasets, the `spatial` data would be copied \
into the `dataset_spatial` field to prevent it from being overwritten by the \
organization spatial.
"""
epilog = """****WHY IS THIS COMMAND NEEDED?****\n
For the ckanext-spatial extension to run spatial queries against datasets, \
they are required to have the `spatial` field. This extension allows setting \
the spatial fields from the organization and the datasets can inherit that if \
they don't have their own spatial defined.\n
To achieve that, a `dataset_spatial` field has been added for datasets and an \
`org_spatial` field has been added for organizations. The `spatial` field \
still tracks the dataset spatial data, but now if a spatial is assigned to the \
dataset, it is stored in the `dataset_spatial` field instead and then copied \
into the `spatial` field before indexing. If no spatial is assigned, the \
spatial defaults to the organization spatial defined in the `org_spatial` \
field.\n
If this feature is just being implemented for the first time, some datasets \
might already have data in their `spatial` fields but their `dataset_spatial` \
fields would be empty, this would mean that the data would get overriden by \
the organization default and would be lost. To prevent that the command was \
created.\n
